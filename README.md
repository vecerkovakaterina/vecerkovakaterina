### About me

My name is Kate≈ôina and I'm a bioinformatician. I work at the Bioinformatics Core Facility of the Institute of Molecular Genetics, where I perform bioinformatic analyses as a service for other research groups. What I enjoy about my job is that I encouter different biological experiments, I get touse many  different analysis tools and I'm learning a lot. At the same time, I'm working on my PhD, where I'm developing a tool that would search for hidden genes.
